                ello, I'm John Paul C. Aquino. I'm currently 3rd year student at Laguna University,
                who are taking Bachelor Of Science in Computer Science With Specialization in Data
                Science, a passionate developer with an experience in building Desktop Application,
                Web Application, API's and Machine Learning. The path I want to pursue are, creating
                API's and creating AI, because both are interesting for me. Back then in my Senior
                High School, the language I used are Java and SQL. These are the languages I used to
                build our capstone project and it's called Chai Bucks Billing System. I am the main
                Developer of our Capstone Project and some of my members are focused on the paper.
                Luckily, we defended our capstone project and advanced to a new chapter, which is
                the College, but after I finished my SHS, I starting to work at factory in EPSON,
                and those 6 months I stopped studying, even coding in an hour, I didn't do, and
                after the school year, I enrolled again in Laguna University and luckily I survived
                those 2 years in college and I have remaining 2 years to finished this and hoping
                that I will finish my college.
